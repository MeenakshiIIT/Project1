# GitHub Users Analysis in Bangalore

- The data was scraped using the GitHub API to collect user profiles and their repositories for developers located in Bangalore with over 100 followers.
- One surprising finding was that hireable users tend to have a significantly higher number of followers compared to non-hireable users, suggesting a correlation between visibility and job readiness.
- It is recommended that developers actively engage with their GitHub communities by creating projects and wikis, as these activities may enhance their visibility and attract more followers.
